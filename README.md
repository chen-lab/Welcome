# Welcome

#My name is Kevin Staples, a Chen Lab graduate from 2017. 

#In 2015, I tried, unsuccessfully to convince Yong and the rest of the Chen Lab that open data and coding was the present/future and that it was important to pivot to this new world. 

#This attempt failed, and this GitHub page is a monument to that failure as a result. 

#Perhaps someday, this page will become active and students will build a tremendous library of learning and knowledge.

#That was/is my hope.
